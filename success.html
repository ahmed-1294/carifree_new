On a couple of occasions, when I ran out or was close to running out of the gel, I had to resort to using the stuff that's sold in drug and grocery stores. I just don't get the same clean and fresh feeling that I have from using this gel. I can't rave about it enough! It's a must-have product for my oral care needs. "</h3>

It was almost impossible for me to rinse for the recommended 30 seconds. I speak from personal experience, as I prefer to try everything myself, if at all possible, before I recommend a product to my patients. I was very skeptical about the new flavor, assuming it would still difficult to rinse for 30 seconds. It does have a definite bleach taste, but no where near as strong as before. The apple flavor is comparable to the mint, in that the bleach flavor still exists, but is not overpowering. Now that the CTx4 Treatment Rinse has an improved taste, I feel so much more comfortable recommending the entire Carifree product line to my patients."</h3>
