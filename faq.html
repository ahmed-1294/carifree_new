                                    It is the only toothpaste to utilize a unique combination of 1.1% fluoride and nano-hydroxyapatite for superior remineralization. Nano-hydroxyapatite is the most bioavailable form of calcium and phosphate for remineralization. Fluoride and nano-hydroxyapatite together create fluorapatite that is more resistant to demineralization than hydroxyapatite alone. In addition, our gel is low abrasive, has an elevated pH of 9 which promotes the growth of healthy bacteria, and contains a therapeutic level of xylitol to increase saliva flow and reduce cavity-causing bacteria. The benefits of this gel are unlike any other. Don’t just take our word for it! Hear from our happy & healthy customers here.

                                    We use sodium hypochlorite, a broad-spectrum and pH elevated component to effectively shift the biofilm to be healthy. Research has identified 60+ strains that can be involved in causing cavities which makes it necessary to use a broad-spectrum antimicrobial that targets all bacteria. Most other antibacterials can only target certain species. Once we have effectively removed the cavity-causing bacteria, it is essential to elevate the pH to repopulate the biofilm with only healthy bacteria. Our Treatment Rinse is above a pH of 10.

                                    No. All CariFree products are free of dye and will not stain teeth.

                                    The Treatment Rinse contains a strong oxidizing agent that can make teeth more susceptible to surface stains caused by what someone eats or drinks after they rinse. We recommend avoiding eating or drinking anything that would stain a white t-shirt (coffee, tea, wine, etc.) for at least 30 minutes after rinsing. Another helpful tip to prevent staining is to switch to only using at night. If staining occurs, it is removable.

                                    pH is the central component of all CariFree products. In a study done by Intertek, the CariFree PRO Gel 5000 toothpaste demonstrated effective pH buffering capabilities in dental plaque, maintaining a range crucial for enamel remineralization during a 20-minute sucrose challenge. This performance indicates the toothpaste’s potential to create an oral environment that favors remineralization and counters the acidogenic effects typically induced by sugar intake.

                                    The average treatment cycle for a high risk patient using the Treatment Rinse is 3-6 months. However, there are many factors that come into play, so we encourage you to use our CRA form to assess your patient every 6 months for the most accurate recommendation. For patients who do not have cavities, and want to continue to prevent it, they can use our other products indefinitely.
